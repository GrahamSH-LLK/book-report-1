title: 'Looking for information on "Greater Thans"'
---
I'm looking for info on "Greater Thans." I've also heard them called "GTs." I can't find any accurate information on them. Does anybody have any information on them? On Urban Dictionary, I found that apparently, "some people—mostly female people—have these... innate mental powers. G-Ts are born with access to more of their brains, and those powers can include telepathy, prescience, and telekinesis.” This sounds a bit crazy. Is this entirely made up? What really are GTs? If you have any information, send it to skylar@8mail.com

**Edit: I now have the information I wanted. Thank you for reading this!**
